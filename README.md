# Python Toolkits for accessing GPT api

## Introduction
openai api provides functionalities for using and fintunining GPT models with customized datasets. It is getting attention in academic fields such as data labeling, literature review, and social media analysis. While Openai published office api packages in Python and JS, there are several packages developed for facilitating the usage of GPT models and chats such as "openai", "TheOpenAIR", and "oaii" in R. 

Instead of wrapping entire Openai api functions, this toolkit aims to facilitate research-oriented activities including literature and comment classification.
